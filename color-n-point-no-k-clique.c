/*
Problem: Color n points such that no K-clique segments have same color
Description
Given n points on the plane. Each segment connecting 2 points is colored by a color from the set {1, 2, ..., C}. Given a positive integer K, compute the number Q of ways to color the segments between n given points such that there does not exist a K-subset (a subset containing K items) of n points in which all segments between the points of the K-subset are colored with the same color.
Input

    Line 1 contains 3 positive integer n, K, and C (1 <= n <= 10, 3 <= K <= 5, 1 <= C <= 3)

 Output
Write the value of Q

Example
Input
3 3 2

Output
6
